// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//let car = 'subaru';
//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//console.log(car == 'subaru')
//• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
//• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
// Test No. 1;
var Mango = "Yellow";
console.log("Is Mango equals to yellow");

// Test No. 2;
var Apple = "Red";
console.log("Is Apple equals to Red");
console.log(Apple == "Red");
// Test No. 3;
var five = 5;
console.log("Five is equal to five");
console.log(five == 5);
// Test No. 4;
var Ten = 10;
console.log("Ten is not equal to 15");
console.log(Ten !== 15);
// Test No. 5;
var car = "Supra";
console.log("Is car equal to supra");
console.log(car == "Supra");
