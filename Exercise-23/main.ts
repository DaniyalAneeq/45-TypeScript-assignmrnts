// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

//let car = 'subaru';

//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

//console.log(car == 'subaru')

//• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

//• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

// Test No. 1;
let Mango = "Yellow";
console.log("Is Mango equals to yellow");
console.log(Mango == "Yellow");

// Test No. 2;
let Apple = "Red";
console.log("Is Apple equals to Red");
console.log(Apple == "Red");

// Test No. 3;
let five = 5;
console.log("Five is equal to five");
console.log(five == 5);

// Test No. 4;
let Ten = 10;
console.log("Ten is not equal to 15");
console.log(Ten !== 15);


// Test No. 5;
let car = "Supra";
console.log("Is car equal to supra");
console.log(car == "Supra");



// Test No. 6;
let mycar = "Revo";
console.log("My car name is Supra");
console.log(mycar == "Supra");

// Test No. 7;
let Six = 6;
console.log("Six is greater than six");
console.log(Six > 6);

// Test No. 8;
let mybook = "Biology";
console.log("my book name is chemistry");
console.log(mybook == "chemistry");

// Test No. 9;
let Seven = 7;
console.log("Seven is not equal to 7");
console.log(Seven !== 7);

// Test No. 10;
let myfavGame = "cricket";
console.log("My favorite game is football");
console.log(myfavGame == "football");
